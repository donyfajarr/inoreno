This is the G****F***** Inno Reno repository, a project management software that focuses on Gantt chart Excel scanning, task reminder scheduling, project monitoring, and PIC feedback through email.

We are concerned about the adaptation span needed for new tools, so interactions among the projects use personal email for communication, and reminders. Feedback from the user and monitoring as a project manager is built into our apps.

The stacks being used are:
- Django and SQLite for backend and Excel processing
- Bootstrap 5 template for the UI
- Nginx as a reverse proxy and static media file handler
- Gunicorn as the WSGI server
- Supervisor as the Gunicorn manager for autorestarting and project reserves

It is built on a bare-metal local vSphere, so adjustments to the API connection are necessary for other purposes.
